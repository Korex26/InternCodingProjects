PROJECT BACKGROUND INFORMATION
- Sandia National Labs Onsite Summer Weapon Subsystems R&D Internship with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (CA) at the Bush Combat Development Complex Research Integration Center (TX) (Full-time 40-hour work weeks).
- I joined a collaborative research group focused on developing better testing procedures for, and broadening the understanding of, Switch Mode Power Converters and DC-to-DC feedback-controlled conversion. Specifically focusing on a Buck Converter with a Type Three (III) Compensator system and its analysis. The supporting mission that required this was the improvement of current conventional systems & technology by transitioning them to a modular based system; ultimately resulting in improved space missions, nuclear disaster response, & radiation hardened systems.
- My individual role included developing a “Method to Obtain Bode Plot of Live DC-to-DC Feedback-Controlled Switch Mode Power Converter with a Tektronix Mixed Signal Comparing Results with Simulink and MATLAB Simulations” which involved the creation and analyzation of bode plots from ideal MATLAB transfer functions, Simulink simulations, and physical circuit tests. The testing procedure and hardware toolset I created were a success and enabled the team to perform tests on other in-development or developed converters. I created a publicized report on the project that can be found on my Linkedin.
- My research partner and I presented our work at the end of the summer in the form of a poster at the CA Summer Intern Symposium and I gave a 10-minuete overview presentation of my summer project. The poster, presentation, and speech can be found on my Linkedin.
